For example, we call an <code>x</code> rotation x because it rotates the puzzle \"around the x-axis\". However, this is unhelpful because rotations don't actually happen around an axis. Instead it's better to think of rotations as happening within a 2D plane. When you're doing an <code>x</code>, the whole puzzle is really being rotated within the zy plane. And writing rotations like this generalizes to higher dimensions, so that is what we use.</p> <p>First, we make a certain side from each axis be the \"positive\" side. There are standards for this in 3D (such as the right-handed rule). On the x-axis, going to the right is positive and going left is negative. This makes <code>R</code> the positive side from the x-axis. The same goes for the other axes: <code>U</code>, and <code>F</code> are the positive sides in 3D. In 4D we add two new sides, and have to decide which one is positive and which one is negative. Because of the projection, the side that we can't see is closer to the 4D camera, making <code>O</code> the positive w-axis cell, and <code>I</code> the negative.</p> <p>To actually notate the rotations, write the letters of the 2 axes that form the plane that the puzzle is rotating in, in the order of which positive side on that axis goes to the positive side of the other axis. For example: rotating the positive y-axis side to the positive x-axis side (rotating U to R) would be written <code>yx</code> (and looks like <code>z</code> in 3D notation).</p> <ul> <li><code>yw</code>: bring +y to +w (rotate U to O)</li> <li><code>xz</code>: bring +x to +z (rotate R to F (this is called <code>y</code> in 3D rotation notation))</li> </ul> <p>Note how we don't have to use the <code>'</code> prime symbol because you can just swap the letters (wy is the inverse of yw). You can also add a <code>2</code> to the end for double rotations, e.g. <code>wx2</code>, <code>yz2</code> etc.</p> <p>This makes it a really nice system because it only ever uses 2 letters, no matter how many dimensions. You can also use it on n3 puzzles in order for more multi-dimensional consistency: <code>xy</code> means move x+ to y+ (R to U [z' rotation]).</p>"},{"location":"notation/#turn-metrics","title":"Turn metrics","text":"<p>There are many different ways to count the number of twists performed during a solve.

The beginner's way to learn this is by \"translating\" 3D algorithms into RKT (although this is not the best way to think about how RKT works beacuse you can really perform any sequence of moves). Below is a simple 3 step guide to translate your algorithms into RKT.</p> <p>Example: Sune algorithm with RKT</p> <p>Say you want to do the Sune algorithm <code>R U R' U R U2 R'</code> with RKT. The first step is to try and think of how you can execute the algorithm using only R moves and cube rotations. <code>R U R' U R U2 R'</code> becomes <code>R z R z' R' z R z' R z R2 z' R'</code>. Now we replace R with RO, and cube rotations with I cell rotations: <code>RO IF RO IF' RO' IF RO IF' RO IF RO2 IF' RO'</code></p> <p></p> <ol> <li>Rewrite the algorithm to only use cube rotations and R moves</li> <li>Rewrite cube rotations in this new algorithm (<code>x</code>, <code>y</code>, or <code>z</code>) to their respective I cell rotation (<code>IR</code>, <code>IU</code>, <code>IF</code>)</li> <li>Replace all R moves with their RO counterpart</li> </ol> <p>This can definitely be very confusing and disorienting to beginners, as you have to think about 3x3x3 moves with only R moves and rotations. It takes a lot of practice to get comfortable with RKT, but it is an extremely powerful technique.</p> <p>The best way to learn RKT before doing your first 34 solve is by manually scrambling the last cell using any RO moves and random I cell rotations until it looks scrambled. Then practice doing PLC by solving it with RKT.</p> <p>Tip</p> <p>Even though this technique is called RKT, it is not limited to those types of turns. Thus, you can use LO and I- moves instead, or rotate your view and use RU and D- instead of RK and I-.</p> <p>Another popular way to do RKT is to use wide O cell turns (instead of normal I cell turns). This has the benefit of keeping the cell you're doing RKT to in the same orientation the entire time. Instead of rotating a side of the I cell to the RI plane, you rotate all the outside layers over the side that you're twisting.</p>"},{"location":"techniques/rkt/#parity","title":"Parity","text":"<p>RKT Parity</p> <p></p> <p>RKT parity is a state you can get to that appears to rotate a single layer of a cell by 180\u00b0.

For example: after executing a T perm algorithm with RKT the R cell will be misaligned by 90\u00b0. RKT Debt always has to be \"paid back\" at some point during the solve. During complicated setup moves for fancy inserts, RKT debt can be used as \"ammo\". That is, undoing the debt in a useful way to help solve the puzzle. An easy way for beginners to \"avoid\" debt is to just do a move on a layer that you don't care about messing up at that point in the solve.

HactarCE made a program called RocKeT to find cancels for 34 algorithms. Often, it just involves inserting some flipping moves at certain points throughout the algorithm.</p> <p>Consider <code>R U R' U'</code>. Conventional RKT rotates after every move, but we don't have to do that. We can build up multiple moves of RKT debt and then cancel them later:</p> <ul> <li><code>RO UO</code> \u2014 do <code>R U</code> using RKT, building up two moves of RKT debt (<code>R U</code>)</li> <li><code>IF RO'</code> \u2014 do <code>R'</code> using RKT, undoing the debt from <code>U</code></li> <li><code>IF2 UO'</code> \u2014 do <code>U'</code> using RKT, undoing the debt from the <code>R</code></li> </ul> <p>But we can do even better!</p> <ul> <li><code>RO UO</code> \u2014 do <code>R U</code> using RKT</li> <li><code>IUR</code> \u2014 swap <code>R</code> with <code>U</code></li> <li><code>UO' RO'</code> \u2014 do <code>R' U'</code> using RKT (because we swapped <code>R</code> and <code>U</code>), undoing the debt from <code>R U</code></li> </ul> <p>If you squint, you might notice that this is a conjugate <code>[RO UO: IUR]</code>. This corresponds to the fact that <code>R U R' U'</code> can be written as a conjugate where one part is a pure rotation: <code>[R U: z x2]</code>. When executing this algorithm, we apply it to <code>I</code> with the rotation (so it's equivalent to <code>R U R' U'</code>) and to the outer layers without the rotation (so <code>[RU: _]</code> expands to <code>R U U' R'</code>, which completely cancels out). This is the fundamental theory behind how to do RKT cancels: by rewriting algorithms as conjugates and commutators with pure rotations.</p> <p>Recall how in 3D you can replace a <code>U y'</code> with <code>Dw</code>. We can do the same thing here: replace <code>IUR</code> with <code>{1-2}OUR</code>, which is a rotation of the outer layers instead of the inner layers. Now it just looks like a normal algorithm with a flip thrown in the middle: <code>RO UO {1-2}OUR RO' UO'</code>. So we can notate it a little more simply: <code>R U {1-2}OUR R' U'</code></p> <p>Here's a more complex example, the Sune algorithm: <code>RO UO RO' {1-2}OUR UO RO {1-2}OUR UO2 RO'</code>. This works because you can rewrite Sune using conjugates with rotations: <code>[R U: [R': z x2] [U: z x2]]</code>. Notice how if you remove the rotations, the whole thing cancels out. (You don't need to expand the conjugates to see this.)</p> <p>Warning</p> <p>You do not need to learn RKT cancel algs to solve any puzzle.
